      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>Project Overview- The Consignment-Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the price of consignment items based on various features and variables. Consignment is a business model in which an individual or business agrees to sell someone else&amp;rsquo;s items on their behalf, typically taking a commission on the final sale price.
This project aims to create a predictive model to help consignment store owners and sellers better understand how to price their items, leading to increased sales and profits.</description>

      <description>Project Overview The Toxic Comment Classification project is an application that uses machine learning to identify toxic comments. The application uses a dataset of comments from social media platforms, such as Twitter, to train a model that can detect toxic comments. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify toxic comments and help moderators filter out comments that violate community guidelines.
Website Dataset The dataset used in this project is the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from Kaggle.</description>
