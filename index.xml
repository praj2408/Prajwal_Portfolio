      <description>Problem Statement: The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not. This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the &amp;gt;50K group or &amp;lt;=50K group.
Dataset Adult Census Income Dateset
The dataset used for this project is the Adult Census Income dataset. It contains information about individuals, such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, gender, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country.</description>

      <description>Project Overview- The Consignment-Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the price of consignment items based on various features and variables. Consignment is a business model in which an individual or business agrees to sell someone else&amp;rsquo;s items on their behalf, typically taking a commission on the final sale price.
This project aims to create a predictive model to help consignment store owners and sellers better understand how to price their items, leading to increased sales and profits.</description>

      <description>Project Overview The Toxic Comment Classification project is an application that uses machine learning to identify toxic comments. The application uses a dataset of comments from social media platforms, such as Twitter, to train a model that can detect toxic comments. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify toxic comments and help moderators filter out comments that violate community guidelines.
Website Dataset The dataset used in this project is the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from Kaggle.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, â€œHis eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>

      <description>Illustration from Victor Hugo et son temps (1881) The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris) is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered. English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England.</description>
